SECTION I: DEFINITION
	Religion and morality are the most important. The two coincide.
	If it is not right don’t do it, if it is not the truth don’t say it.

SECTION II: OTHERS
	Be respectful of those around you and your environment by not listening to or watching electronic devices.
	All people have asked you to protect their rights.
	You are not to convince Catholicism is correct through words, but through good deeds.

SECTION III: PERSONAL
	Questions of morality must be asked to the wise and the rash.
	There is only one God, from whom all your rights derive, alongside reason. Each right is endowed to all people. The gratuity is carried out in both word and deed. In word, by silent appreciation and vocal declarations of appreciation. In deed, by exercising each freedom justly and frequently.
	God is to be worshipped daily by praying in times of need, thanking in times of prosperity, and reading, reflecting, and journaling on a Bible passage each day.
	In cases of debate over how the Common Good should be carried out, two situations exist: enough time and not enough time.
	Cases of enough time require inquiry from the wise and the rash. Your decision is not to be settled by how you feel, but by achievement of freedoms and the accomplishments for the Common Good.
	Cases of not enough time require quick thinking while trusting in your initial reaction.
	Hypocrisy and cowardice are the two greatest vices by you, and are to be avoided.
	Swearing is not permitted. 
	You are to trust in God’s plan.
	You are allowed to pursue your own personal objectives. If your attempts at this objective fail continually, it is time to analyze what God may want from you in regards to this objective.
