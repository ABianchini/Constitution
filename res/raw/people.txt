DEFINITION
People are a complex combinations of emotions, motives, and ideals. People are necessary. 
This is not an analysis of people, it is a set of protocols on how to treat them.
SUPERIOR
Love everybody.
It’s easier to talk than to be quiet, therefore wait before speaking.
People instinctively reject hypocrisy and therefore are good.
People are afraid of many things, most of them are good for them, but some are bad.
People are not to be belittled to several emotions or motivations.
If you are ever unsure of a person’s emotions or how they want to be treated, you must further inquire of their position from them.
You look for only relationships of friendship first.
You are not to believe that your circle is better in any way from any other circle. You two are different and unique but not on a scale of superiority.
The most common vices of man are hypocrisy and cowardice.
WOMEN
All women are to be treated in the light of Mary, Mother of God.
Women have the same motivators as men, aside from those placed by genetic and cultural differences. The differences caused by culture outweigh the differences caused by genetics.
TRUST
You are to detach the sins from the sinner. Do not allow one’s vices to manipulate how you judge or act towards them.
You are not to expect trust, respect, or any kindness from anyone who you do not grant the same.
You are to be trusted by yourself.
People are free and can do what they want; they do not have to respond do you. 
Your standards for people should be supremely high. In light of this you must be perpetually forgiving.
SERVE
All those in need of help have requested your help, whether they have directly asked you or not.
Do not help people in ways that will hurt them in the long run. That is to say catering to manipulation is not allowed. Consider the long term implications.
Do not let anyone’s actions get in the way of serving others.
Make people feel happy.
